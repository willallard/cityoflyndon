                <h3>About Lyndon</h3>
                
                <p>Welcome to the City of Lyndon’s official website. Lyndon is a 4th class city with a little over 11,000 residents. Founded in 1871, the City was officially incorporated in 1965. The population at the time of incorporation was about 500, so you can see we have experienced rapid growth.</p>
                <p>There are 500+ businesses in Lyndon, ranging from the International Air Headquarters of UPS to small home occupations. The Louisville Economic Chamber of Commerce (Lou-E) works with the City throughout the year, particularly on special events like the Lyndon Summer Festival and the annual holiday celebration of “Light Up Lyndon”.</p>
                <p>The City prides itself on Robsion Park, a 17 acre green space with walking paths and playgrounds for all to use. We have also acquired a 10+ acre historic site which was restored to provide additional passive recreation opportunities for our residents.
Many improvements have taken place in the last 10 years, but more are planned. Stay connected to this website to follow all current projects the City is undertaking.</p>
                <p>Once again, welcome to our site - we hope you will enjoy your visit!</p>
                <br>

              <h3>Romara Place</h3>
              <h6>501 Rmara Place Louisville, KY 40222</h6>
              <p>In 2002 the City purchased a 10+ acre property on Wood Road known as Romara Place.
This was once the home of Lyndon founder, Alvin Wood. The property includes a house,
stone garage, and a stone outbuilding. The garage was thought to have originally been used
as a carriage house, and the outbuilding a springhouse or a smokehouse.</p>
              <p>The renovation of the carriage house in 2003 provides an apartment for a caretaker of the property. In 2007 renovation of the house began and is now complete.  The house has been furnished with several
pieces donated by descendants of Alvin Wood.  An open house for the community took place in
September 2011.</p>
              <p>An approximate 1/4 mile walking path is open to the public.  Benches have been placed
along the path to stop and enjoy the beauty of the natural surroundings.  Directions from the 4-way stop
at Lyndon Ln. and Wood Rd.: Go east on Wood Rd. ¼ block to the second entrance on your left.</p>
              <p>Romara Place is now available to host your special event.</p>
